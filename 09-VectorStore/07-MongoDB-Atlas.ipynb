              "[Document(metadata={'chapter': 0}, page_content=\"The Little Prince\\nWritten By Antoine de Saiot-Exupery (1900ã€œ1944)\\n\\n[ Antoine de Saiot-Exupery ]\\nOver the past century, the thrill of flying has inspired some to perform remarkable feats of daring. For others, their desire to soar into the skies led to dramatic leaps in technology. For Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, his love of aviation inspired stories, which have touched the hearts of millions around the world.\\nBorn in 1900 in Lyons, France, young Antoine was filled with a passion for adventure. When he failed an entrance exam for the Naval Academy, his interest in aviation took hold. He joined the French Army Air Force in 1921 where he first learned to fly a plane. Five years later, he would leave the military in order to begin flying air mail between remote settlements in the Sahara desert.\\nFor Saint-ExupÃ©ry, it was a grand adventure - one with dangers lurking at every corner. Flying his open cockpit biplane, Saint-ExupÃ©ry had to fight the desert's swirling sandstorms. Worse, still, he ran the risk of being shot at by unfriendly tribesmen below. Saint-ExupÃ©ry couldn't have been more thrilled. Soaring across the Sahara inspired him to spend his nights writing about his love affair with flying.\\nWhen World War II broke out, Saint-ExupÃ©ry rejoined the French Air Force. After Nazi troops overtook France in 1940, Saint-ExupÃ©ry fled to the United States. He had hoped to join the U. S. war effort as a fighter pilot, but was dismissed because of his age. To console himself, he drew upon his experiences over the Saharan desert to write and illustrate what would become his most famous book, The Little Prince (1943). Mystical and enchanting, this small book has fascinated both children and adults for decades. In the book, a pilot is stranded in the midst of the Sahara where he meets a tiny prince from another world traveling the universe in order to understand life. In the book, the little prince discovers the true meaning of life. At the end of his conversation with the Little Prince, the aviator manages to fix his plane and both he and the little prince continue on their journeys \\nShortly after completing the book, Saint-ExupÃ©ry finally got his wish. He returned to North Africa to fly a warplane for his country. On July 31, 1944, Saint-ExupÃ©ry took off on a mission. Sadly, he was never heard from again.\\n\\n[ TO LEON WERTH ]\\nI ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children-- although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication: \\nTO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'chapter': 1}, page_content='- we are introduced to the narrator, a pilot, and his ideas about grown-ups\\nOnce when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. \\n(picture)\\nIn the book it said: \"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.\" \\nI pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this: \\n(picture)\\nI showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.\\nBut they answered: \"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?\" \\nMy drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: \\n(picture)\\nThe grown-upsâ€˜ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.\\nSo then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable. \\nIn the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at hand. And that hasnâ€˜t much improved my opinion of them.\\nWhenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:\\n\"That is a hat.\"\\nThen I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.')]"
